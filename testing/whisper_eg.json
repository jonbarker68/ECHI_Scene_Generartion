I can't even remember, so long ago. No, I did my undergraduate degree and as part of that was my final year I had an industry project that was like NLP oriented. You know like the Higher Education Statistics Agency sort of thing, HESA, they basically like track the outcome of like graduates from each like institution and then I guess to see how they perform and what sort of jobs they go in depending on the degree that they did and based on the institution that they went to and they've got something called like a SOC code which sort of quantifies the level of responsibility associated with each job and you have to like apply a SOC code to each job sort of thing yeah it's kind of yeah basically so there's something called the graduate outcomes survey where you have to self-describe your job title as well as a few responsibilities and then based on that data they assign a SOC code so it's basically just like",
